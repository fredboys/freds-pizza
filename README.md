# Fred's Pizza

Fred's pizza is a popular family pizza restaurant that wants to expand their already successful business onto the online market. 

Therefore I have built a programme which allows the user to place an order online which gives Fred's pizza another avenue of making money.

This fully python written programme is run on a mock terminal.
